  <h1>Goober</h1>

Name inspired from Spider-Verse.

An interpreted, dynamically typed, object oriented programming language built in Java. The interpreter traverses abstract syntax tree generated by parser and evaluates each Node to run program (tree-walk interpreter). The goal was to gain a conceptual understanding of how programming languages are built and work under the hood (unboxing the black box).
