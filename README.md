  <h1>Goober (jLox)</h1>
</div>

The name is inspired from Spider-Verse.

An interpreted, dynamically typed, object oriented programming language built in Java. The interpreter traverses the abstract syntax tree generated by parser and evaluates each Node to run a program (tree-walk interpreter). It is essentially Lox with more features, and a slightly different syntax.

The goal was to gain a conceptual understanding of how programming languages are built and work under the hood (unboxing the black box). Additionally, the challenge instilled a deeper understanding of Computer Science and programming within.
